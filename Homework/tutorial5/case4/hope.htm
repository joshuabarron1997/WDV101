	<h1 class = "title">Planet Hope</h1>
	
	<p class = "center">Planet Hope is a celestial body that was recently discovered that has the possibility of cultivating a civilization of humans.
 The planet is near enough for Earth Hope easy travel and offers a forgiving atmosphere and many valuble resources not found on earth.
 For the first couple generations of humans on Hope, life would likely be glorified mining colonies governed by the United States, once sustainable, will become its own goverment.</p>

	<h2>Life on Hope</h2>

	<p>Life on planet Hope would likely be demanding work. There is a good chance there is engineers and construction workers there first to construct the basis for a new civilization. After that is settled only a select couple ten thousand should be allowed access.</p>
	<ul> <span class = "line">Requirements For Hope</span>
		<li>Age: 20+</li>
		<li>Education: GED</li>
		<li>No criminal offenses</li></ul>
	<p>For the first couple decades residents on Hope would recieve care packages from earth until sustainable, once on there own legs they will have the option to elect an offical to office and create their own goverment.<br>
<br>
	It Should be noted that while the United States plans to take the brunt of the expenses and work, any United Nations member is allowed to participate in populating and creating embasies on Hope, although the latter may come in time.</p>
