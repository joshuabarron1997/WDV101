			<p>Founded in 1996 we are Springfield's only no-kill animal shelter.<br>
				 Since its opening Pets to Go has placed an estimated 18,000 homeless cats and dogs in new households. Where do these animals come from? 40% are owner surrenders<br>
				 and the other 60% are animals we rescues from shelters that euthanize.<br><br>
							We have a dedicated staff of 15 (half are part-time).<br>
				 And our 200-plus volunteers are our backbone (thank you volunteers and donors!).<br>
				 Many of the rescued animals who come to <em>Pets to Go</em><br>
				 get more love and attention in our shelter than they've ever known before.<br>
				 Our shelter continues to grow and improve. Drop by and get to know us better!</p>
